# Courses

If you're reading this, hello! I should explain what this is.

A while ago, I started compiling a bucket list of things I'd like to learn and projects I want to eventually create. These are pretty varied, including multiple programming languages and fields of study. These include, but are not limited to

 - Data science
   - Neural networks (from scratch)
   - Linear regression
   - Web scraping
   - Data processing
 - Computer Science
   - Data structures
   - Algorithms
   - Discrete Mathematics
   - Processor Architecture 
 - Graphics
   - 3D Graphics using OpenGL
   - 3D Graphics using Vulkan
   - Creating a 2D/3D game engine from scratch
 - Simulation
   - Create a 3D fluids simulation
   - Race track simulation and racing line finder
   - Optical race strategies calculator
   - Ray tracing
   - Simulation of a PC
 - Much more!

This lead to me signing up for a number of courses and purchasing a number of books. However, I found myself overwhelmed by the choice; I ended up not doing any of them for a while. So, I've decided to pick one course at a time, see it through, and then carry those skills into the next project.   

While I'm at it, I thought that I might as well keep track of those courses, and present what I've managed to do. Effectively prove that I've actually done the courses by publishing as much code as I have left over. Eventually, I might transfer my notes here (from one of my many, many moleskine notebooks I bought when I was briefly obsessed with them).   

I have a separate, currently private repository for things I have learned from books, though I will occasionally add an "additional work" folder showcasing work from books I don't specifically focus on.
